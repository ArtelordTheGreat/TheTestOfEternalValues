Birthed like demons, same death angels
Monsters of kill, urge and slaughter
Darkened real hearts, we were alive
Long ago was not all like this?

Hunger's stronger, but what's coming?
I see faces, they're all glowing
Something unknown hiding out there
How can we be what we once were?
I just want to know what I was...
Is it hard to choose your own course?

Breath in deeper, breath out slowly
We're no killers, look like monsters
Trapped in try to keep what's yourself
Even supressed, break the surface
Deep inside there's still a soul left

Crawled on the ground, fly up higher
Reach the sky but can't touch the clouds
Even these wings don't let us free
How can we be what we wanted?
Change our fates, don't be forgotten

[pause]
Can we bring back what was behind?
Change our fates and the design?
And choose the way how we align?
How were we forged? Shall we break dawn?
The pace of world starts to slow down
The battle cries for our ground
Your inner self will never bow
So sing your last loud battlecry
What the?..

Breath in deeper, breath out slowly
We're no killers, look like monsters
Trapped in try to keep what's yourself
Even supressed, break the surface
Deep inside there's still a soul left

[pause]
Can we change our minds, can we change our lives?
Can we face what decided to make us go blind?
Take out blades, sharp the claws, 'cause we'll get our demise
It's the end of the times, but to Null we fight back!
After all, what was gone, after all left behind
After all who have died don't ask why you survived
That "great" Solver's not good, yellow code that corrupts
We have souls of own kind, do not let it...

Breath in deeper, breath out slowly
We're no killers, look like monsters
Trapped in try to keep what's yourself
Even supressed, break the surface
Deep inside there's still a soul left

Deep inside there's still a soul left

Breath in deeper, breath out slowly
Breath in deeper, breath out slowly
Trapped inside but breath out slowly...
